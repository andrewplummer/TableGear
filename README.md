TableGear is a software package for working with data on the web. It is designed get your data into a web page, and let you work with it quickly and easily, the way you would in powerful desktop applications like Excel.

TableGear is...

* 100% XHTML compliant.
* designed for PHP and MySQL, but can still be used on other systems.
* built on the MooTools Javascript framework.
* and now on the jQuery framework as well!
* degradable for browsers without Javascript, like mobile devices.
* quick, allowing you to be more productive.
* customizable, giving you total control over your tables and form elements.
* well documented, so you can learn how to use it quickly.

The TableGear package has two parts. The PHP side is concerned with fetching data, formatting it, and getting it into an XHTML table. It also handles submitted data, both from AJAX calls and a standard POST, and returns data to the application. The Javascript side handles the client-side functions that make the tables dynamic including sorting, editing and keyboard shortcuts. These scripts can be used independently, but are designed to be used together.
